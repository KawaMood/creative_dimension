# ü™ÑIntroduction

## What is Creative Dimension?

Minecraft survival players ofently want to pre-desing their buildings or ideas in creative mode before creating them in their survival world. If you own a survival server and want to collaborate on such project, it would require another server or a multiverse plugin to provide two different worlds, with splited inventories and a specific gamemode.

Creative Dimension data pack offers the ability to create portals on your survival world that can teleport players in a dedicated creative dimension. Their inventory (including ender chest one), xp, health, gamemode, and effects will be stored and they will retrieve them back when they join a vanilla dimension back. Thus, you can finally test your ideas together and play in survival mode on a vanilla server.

_Of course, you can also use this data pack in single player._

## Installing details

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer: It is important to not that this data pack use worldgen features, that are still considered as **experimental** by Mojang. Installing it is easy, but removing it is harder. Check the "Uninstall" section further for more information.

After having placed the data pack in the `/datapacks` folder of your world, you would need to **restart** the server (or world in single player) completly. As it involves worldgen features, a single `/reload` won't be enough to install it correctly.

## How to join the Creative Dimension?

After you installed the data pack, you will be able to create a new type of block : the **Pot'al** (which is a pot, that creates a portal). The recipe of this block is the following one:

In this pot'al, you can place a plant that will grow into a **Creative Portal**.
The pot accepts different types of plants: oak sappling, birch sappling, dark oak sappling, warped fungus and crimson fungus.

Each plant would grow into their respective variant of portal.

</details>

Planting them will run a short animation, after what the portal will be ready to use.
You just need to stand in the middle of it (where the light block is), and the portal will teleport your to the creative dimension.

## How to exit the creative dimension?

In order to return to reality, you will need to consume a **slow falling** potion. You can also splash one on yourself. The goal is just to get the effect.  
After some seconds, you will be teleported back to the vanilla dimension.

## How to customize or disable a portal?

Creative portals actually have a single block's that matters: the light block, in the middle of them. You can alter all blocks around it if you want to customize the design of the portal, till you don't touch to this block.

Removing this light block will disable the relative portal. You can then remove the rest of the structure, and it will be like it has never existed.

# ‚öôÔ∏èSettings

<details>
<summary>Disable creative portals use</summary>

If enabled, players won't be able to use creative portals anymore. It is useful if you want to temporary restrict the access to the Creative Dimension. You can **enable**, **disable** or **get** the current state of the setting using these following commands respectively:

```
/function pk_cr_di:settings/disable_portals_use/true
/function pk_cr_di:settings/disable_portals_use/false
/function pk_cr_di:settings/disable_portals_use/get
```

# üßπ Uninstall

As Creative Dimension involves worldgen, it is quite technical to uninstall it properly. If you're not confident with the following process, you can join the [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/w8s9XWgN6v) and ask for support with uninstallation on your world.

You can also watch the dedicated part of the [official video](https://youtu.be/m3Jc3KeQi-U) to follow steps precisely.

First, be sure that no player currently are or previously leaved the server while being in the creative dimension.

As my other data packs, Creative Dimension comes with an automatic uninstallation process to uninstall its content (excluding worldgen content). Running it will:

- Remove all pot'als from each dimension
- Disable all creative portals from each dimension (it won't remove the structure itself)
- Remove all scores and storage specific to the Creative Dimension data pack
- If there is no more KawaMood data packs installed, also remove all common scores and storages

The command to start the uninstalling process is the following one:

```
/function pk_cr_di:cmd/uninstall
```

If you stop the unsintalling process at this step, then the dimension would still exists, but couldn't be joined anymore. If the goal is just to temporary remove the data pack to update your world on a version that data pack doesn't handle yet, then you can stop at this step for the moment, it will be enough.

If you wish to remove it completely from your world, here is the difficult part:  
You would first need to remove the data pack from the `/datapacks` folder of your world, but the dimension would still exists. In order to remove it, you need to go (from the root of your world) in the `/dimensions` folder and remove the folder `pk_cr_di`.

But Minecraft will still keeps the dimension references in the `level.dat` file of your world.
So you will need to use [NBTExplorer](https://github.com/jaquadro/NBTExplorer) to remove each pk_cr_di:creative_superflat occurences from the `level.dat` file.

I know this is quite technical, but sadly, worldgen is still considered as an experimental feature, and Mojang didn't provide a way to more directly get rid of unused dimensions yet.
